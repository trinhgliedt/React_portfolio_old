                <p className="card-text">I love the convenience of being able to browse and shop for clothes from the comfort of your home, and I also think eCommerce sites are widely needed by many businesses. Both of those reasons had me want to try building this site for our Python stack coding bootcamp project.  We used Python, HTML, CSS for front-end and Django framework for back-end. We also utilized Django Admin function to upload product photos and product details. </p>

This application could detect user's current location and, upon their consent, display the maps for their location. Users could also search to view the AQI for a specific location, or for the whole U.S. and filter to the relevant AQI value that they want to see. </p>
