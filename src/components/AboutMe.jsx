        <p>I am a solution seeker who fell in love with coding, and I have an undying curiosity about all things tech. I love tackling complex technical problems and devising elegant, efficient solutions that impact people’s everyday lives.</p>
        <p>
        I come from a non-traditional coding background. I have degrees in Environmental Engineering in Vietnam, and then moved to the United States to study Business. I’m also a CPA with an active license. I have spent the last 9 years in the accounting world, during which time I honed a meticulous and efficient approach to solving complex problems, as well as customer-facing and collaboration skills.
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm all about optimizing systems (another skill I developed while accounting!), so when I saw the opportunity at a prior job to eliminate a repetitive process and save the team a bunch of time, I jumped on it! I self-taught programming skills in Excel, and wrote a program that saved our team a ridiculous number of man hours.
        </p>

        This was one of the experiences that helped me discover my passion for coding and start down the path to becoming a software developer. I joined Coding Dojo Bootcamp and have learned 3 full stacks within 14 weeks (Python, MERN and Java). Coding Dojo is a highly collaborative learning environment where I built functional and responsive applications in dynamic, small-team settings.
